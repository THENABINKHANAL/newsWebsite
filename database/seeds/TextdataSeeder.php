Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University is the one prominent institute which was established in 1984 with the initial motto to produce highly skilled technical human resources for the nation. Now the instituteâ€™s objective is added to develop the nation through research and innovation and establish as top ranked university via research, innovation and development. IOE is providing engineering education on several streams via bachelor, masters and Ph.D. program.
